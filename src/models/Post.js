// ad, ads, and banners are blocked by default you will need to combine the search query and the pagination. look at pokemon fireside for pagination
// the for likes and unlikes you just have to make a correct post req. you don't need a body. make like icon visible only to logged in users or have a toast error for non-logged in users
// do not just save res.data.map for posts, you need pagination
// start with posts and ads so that they render before login
// no sorting needed
